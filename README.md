The purpose of the database is to manage and keep track of customer information, vehicle reservation, booking, and confirmation.

This database is to keep track of customerâ€™s information that includes what vehicle they rented, name, address, phone number, date hired, credit card information, passport number, license number, etc.  
And Vehicle rental service have a record of the customers and the vehicles they rent. And according to the vehicle type and number of days they rent it for, determines the prices for rental. 
A vehicle rental service must have a record to display booking availability and reservation confirmations along with vehicle type. 

About this course-
Database Applications is a continuation of Database Concepts. We learned to design database from Concepts and now we are developing it into a complete computer application with documentation. 


Installation:
1. Install MAMP.
2. Start MAMP which will display a window. Click start. 
3. After you start it will direct you to MAMP website. Click on phpMyAdmin.
4. Click on the databases tab and add your script. My Database script is:

CREATE TABLE Customer
(
  Name INT NOT NULL,
  CreditCard_Info INT NOT NULL,
  contact_number INT NOT NULL,
  License_number INT NOT NULL,
  Customer_ID INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (Customer_ID),
  UNIQUE (CreditCard_Info),
  UNIQUE (License_number)
);

CREATE TABLE Vehicle
(
  Passenger_capacity INT NOT NULL,
  Registration_plate_ INT NOT NULL,
  fuel_range INT NOT NULL,
  availability INT NOT NULL,
  Customer_ID INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (Registration_plate_),
  FOREIGN KEY (Customer_ID) REFERENCES Customer(Customer_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE Maintenance
(
  MStart_date INT NOT NULL,
  MFinish_date INT NOT NULL,
  Registration_plate_ INT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (Registration_plate_) REFERENCES Vehicle(Registration_plate_)
);

CREATE TABLE Vehicle_insurance
(
  insurance INT NOT NULL,
  Registration_plate_ INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (insurance, Registration_plate_),
  FOREIGN KEY (Registration_plate_) REFERENCES Vehicle(Registration_plate_)
);

CREATE TABLE Passenger_capacity
(
  vehicle_type INT NOT NULL,
  Registration_plate_ INT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (Registration_plate_) REFERENCES Vehicle(Registration_plate_)
);

5) If you added tables to your database, you will now see a + next to the database name, denoting there are tables in the databse. Click on that to open the database and see the tables. Then click on a table and the Structure tab to see the table structure view.

Next you add values-

INSERT INTO `Customer` (`Name`, `CreditCard_Info`, `contact_number`, `License_number`, `Customer_ID`) VALUES ('Mark ', '16251711', '098271616', '172618161', '7865');
INSERT INTO `Maintenance` (`MStart_date`, `MFinish_date`, `Registration_plate_`) VALUES ('2021-06-08', '2021-06-15', '12311036');!
INSERT INTO `Passenger_capacity` (`vehicle_type`, `Registration_plate_`) VALUES ('van', '12311032');
INSERT INTO `Vehicle` (`Passenger_capacity`, `Registration_plate_`, `fuel_range`, `availability`, `Customer_ID`) VALUES ('32', '12311032', '2500', '3', '2413');
INSERT INTO `Vehicle_insurance` (`insurance`, `Registration_plate_`) VALUES ('No', '12311032');


In order to communicate with the database:
1) The code must be saved in htdocs which is under MAMP application.
2) and after you save it type in http://localhost:8888/
